From one of the freight cars jumps a weary-eyed transient with dreams of a fresh start in a new town. Instead, he lands smack-dab in the middle of an urban hellhole, a place where the cops are crooked and the underprivileged masses are treated like insignificant animals. This is a city where crime reigns supreme, and the man pulling the strings is known only as \"The Drake.\" Along with his two cold-blooded and sadistic sons, Ivan and Slick, he rules with an iron fist, and nobody dares fuck with The Drake, especially not some hobo. Director Jason Eisener's blood-soaked return to the Sundance Film Festival is more than just a nod to the grindhouse flicks of the 1970s and '80s; he ups the ante in a major way, and Rutger Hauer's performance is a legendary display of brutal ass-kicking and meticulous name-taking that is not to be missed. -- (C) Magnet","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3R1jFV7hGPRMt21e6iNOT45xmps=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155166_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3R1jFV7hGPRMt21e6iNOT45xmps=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155166_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3R1jFV7hGPRMt21e6iNOT45xmps=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155166_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3R1jFV7hGPRMt21e6iNOT45xmps=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155166_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Rutger Hauer","id":"162662499","characters":["Hobo"]},{"name":"Gregory Smith","id":"162654787","characters":["Slick"]},{"name":"Molly Dunsworth","id":"771081776","characters":["Abby"]},{"name":"Brian Downey","id":"770702055","characters":["The Drake"]},{"name":"Nick Bateman (II)","id":"771093678","characters":["Ivan"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jason Eisener"}],"studio":"Magnolia Releasing","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1640459"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1640459","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hobo_with_a_shotgun/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206377/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206377/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206377/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206377.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
