But in reality, trying to mother Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook), who clearly don't want her around, is her toughest challenge yet. Also, her husband, Wilbur (Joel McHale), wouldn't know a spy if he lived with one which is exactly the case - Marissa's a retired secret agent. Marissa's world is turned upside down when the maniacal Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) threatens to take over the planet and she's called back into action by the head of OSS, home of the greatest spies and where the now-defunct Spy Kids division was created. With a little help from a couple of very familiar Spy Kids, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara), they just may be able to save the world and possibly bring their family together while they're at it. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UyxgYmGmR0RBvymAllQT775H3Oo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176504_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UyxgYmGmR0RBvymAllQT775H3Oo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176504_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UyxgYmGmR0RBvymAllQT775H3Oo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176504_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UyxgYmGmR0RBvymAllQT775H3Oo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176504_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jessica Alba","id":"162652782","characters":["Marissa Wilson"]},{"name":"Ricky Gervais","id":"378620549","characters":["Argonaut"]},{"name":"Joel McHale","id":"770792384","characters":["Wilbur Wilson"]},{"name":"Jeremy Piven","id":"162654464","characters":["Danger D'Amo/Tick Tock/Time Keeper"]},{"name":"Alexa Vega","id":"162662385","characters":["Carmen Cortez"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"studio":"Weinstein Company","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1517489"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1517489","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spy_kids_all_the_time_in_the_world_in_4d/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036679/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036679/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036679/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036679.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
