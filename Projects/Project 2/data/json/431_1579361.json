But through his Extreme Ice Survey, he discovers undeniable evidence of our changing planet. In Chasing Ice, Balog deploys revolutionary time-lapse cameras to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers. His hauntingly beautiful videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. Traveling with a team of young adventurers across the brutal Arctic, Balog risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story facing humanity. As the debate polarizes America, and the intensity of natural disasters ramps up globally, Chasing Ice depicts a heroic photojournalist on a mission to deliver fragile hope to our carbon-powered planet. -- (C) Submarine","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BR0YfdF18dAMNL9P1S77SF13nSM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167188_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BR0YfdF18dAMNL9P1S77SF13nSM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167188_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BR0YfdF18dAMNL9P1S77SF13nSM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167188_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BR0YfdF18dAMNL9P1S77SF13nSM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167188_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Balog","id":"770862497","characters":["James"]},{"name":"Adam LeWinter","id":"771394542","characters":["Adam LeWinter"]},{"name":"Jeff Orlowski","id":"771393140","characters":["Jeff Orlowski"]},{"name":"Svavar Jonatansson","id":"771394541","characters":["Svavar Jonatansson"]},{"name":"Louie Psihoyos","id":"770828280","characters":["Louie Psihoyos"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jeff Orlowski"}],"studio":"National Geographic","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1579361"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1579361","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_ice_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267237/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267237/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267237/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267237.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
