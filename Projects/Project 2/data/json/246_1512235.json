When sad-sack loser Frank (Rainn Wilson) sees his ex-addict wife (Liv Tyler) willingly snatched by a seductive drug dealer (Kevin Bacon), he finds himself bereft and wholly unable to cope. But soon he decides to fight back under the guise of a DIY superhero called Crimson Bolt. With a hand-made suit, a wrench, and a crazed sidekick named Boltie (Ellen Page), the Crimson Bolt beats his way through the mean streets of crime in hopes of saving his wife. The rules were written a long time ago: You are not supposed to molest children, cut lines or key cars; if you do, prepare to face the wrath of the Crimson Bolt! No stranger to rebel filmmaking, James Gunn cut his teeth writing for Troma before making his directing debut with 2006's SLITHER. In a similar vein, his follow-up feature combines absurd humor with balls-out violence to create something that is both unashamed and inimitable. But this time Gunn adds a new ingredient, one that is dark, dramatic and subversive to the core. -- (c) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/HsWyMPUR3kRjaH17fNguBlOyzvA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155913_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/HsWyMPUR3kRjaH17fNguBlOyzvA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155913_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/HsWyMPUR3kRjaH17fNguBlOyzvA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155913_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/HsWyMPUR3kRjaH17fNguBlOyzvA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155913_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Rainn Wilson","id":"518921437","characters":["Frank Darbo"]},{"name":"Ellen Page","id":"326392013","characters":["Libby"]},{"name":"Liv Tyler","id":"162661412","characters":["Sarah"]},{"name":"Kevin Bacon","id":"162654658","characters":["Jacques"]},{"name":"Michael Rooker","id":"162724222","characters":["Abe"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"James Gunn"}],"studio":"IFC Midnight","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1512235"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1512235","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/super-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875072/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875072/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875072/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875072.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
