\frametitle{2. T corrects for uncertainty introduced by plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$}

\begin{itemize}

\item CLT says $\bar{x} \sim N(mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, but, in practice, 
we use $s$ instead of $\sigma$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Plugging in an estimate introduces additional uncertainty.
\item We make up for this by using a more ``conservative" distribution than the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Also has a bell shape, but its tails are \hl{thicker} than the normal model's
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations are more likely to fall beyond two SDs from the mean than under the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Extra thick tails are helpful for mitigating the effect of a less reliable estimate for the standard 
error of the sampling distribution.

Water samples collected at the same location, on the surface and in the bottom, cannot be assumed to be independent of each other, hence we need to use a \hl{paired} analysis.

\frametitle{Analyzing paired data}

Suppose we want to compare the average zinc concentration levels in the bottom and surface:

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item When two sets of observations have this special correspondence (not independent), they are said to be \hl{paired}.

\pause

\item To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. 

\pause

\item It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order.
