What should be a simple job for Arjan, a master tracker, turns into a gripping and dangerous game of cat and mouse as Kereama repeatedly escapes and is recaptured - all the while insisting on his innocence. As each man gains and loses the upper hand, they gradually get to know and respect one another. Culminating in an emotional and high risk showdown, they find they have more in common than simply a mutual hatred of the British.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BglLtudER_6ORPLe0WG49ZCla3U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151765_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BglLtudER_6ORPLe0WG49ZCla3U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151765_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BglLtudER_6ORPLe0WG49ZCla3U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151765_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BglLtudER_6ORPLe0WG49ZCla3U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151765_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ray Winstone","id":"162693523"},{"name":"Temuera Morrison","id":"196103011"},{"name":"Andy Anderson","id":"364625234"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Ian Sharp"}],"studio":"Kaleidoscope","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1414378"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1414378","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tracker/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873431/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873431/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873431/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873431.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
