Sta 101 TA Responsibilities
===========================

#### Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel & Dr. Monod
#### Fall 2015

Welcome Sta 101 TAs! We're looking forward to working with you
this semester.

This document contains information for Sta 101 TAs regarding the course
format and their responsibilities. The document is comprised of two parts:

- Part 1: Responsibilities of all TAs
- Part 2: Additional responsibilities of head TAs

Before reading this document, first review the course syllabus at 
https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall15/sta101.002/syllabus/ to familiarize
yourself with course components and policies.

**Note:** If you catch any erros on this document submit a pull request/issue,
or just email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel.

## Part 1: Responsibilities of all TAs

Some TAs are assigned to lead lab sections and others are responsible for 
attending lectures to to help out with active learning portions of the course 
(readiness assessments, application exercises, etc.).

### Leading a lab section:

- This course uses R/RStudio. For purposes of this course access RStudio at 
https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers using your NetID.
- Students are expected to create completely reproducible lab reports and 
projects using RMarkdown/knitr. Prior to the first lab make sure that you 
are familiar with these tools / packages.
- Get to lab a few minutes earlier to make sure the instructor computer and 
projector are working. 
- Take attendance during the lab sections. You can do this informally 
(as opposed to calling out names) and use it as an opportunity to get to 
know your students' names. Print out the team roster for your section and 
check of names as you interact with each team. (Attendance information will 
be useful when grading the lab reports.)
- Flow of lab sections: 
    + 5-10 minutes of introduction to lab and the data set. Make sure students 
    are engaged (not going ahead with the lab on their computers). This 
    introduction should convey the main ideas / skills of the lab.
    + Let students continue with the lab (in teams) while you spend a little bit 
    of time with each team and answer any questions. You should *never* be just 
    sitting behind the instructor computer.
    + From time-to-time address the whole class, making sure teams are progressing 
    roughly at the same rate, and go over any challenging exercises.
    + At the end of the lab for the first few weeks remind the students the 
    deadline and submission instructions.
- During the lab sections you're also tasked with ensuring smooth and efficient 
teamwork:
    - If any students are unengaged explicitly ask them to work with their teams.
    - Ask students to change their seating order each week so that each student 
    gets a chance to be in the "middle".
    - Ensure that teams follow the author assignments, and tha t the authors 
    rotate each week.
- If you must miss a lab, make arrangements for another TA to fill in for you well 
in advance, and notify the professor of this change prior to the lab session 
you're missing.

### Facilitating active learning in the classroom:

- Readiness assessments:
    + Each unit starts with a readiness assessment that students first take
    individually using their clickers, and then take as a team on scratch off
    sheets.
    + During the individual portion walk around to ensure no cheating and
    answer any questions (some might be about how to use the clickers).
    + During the team portion distribute scratch off sheets one / team, 
    and collect these and readiness assessments when time is called.
    + When the professor is reviewing the readiness assessment, enter grades on
    team portion to Sakai (1 pt for question right on the first try, 0.5 pts
    for right on the second try, 0 pts for 3rd try onwards).
- Application exercises:
    + Pass out blank sheets for teams to use
    + Walk around and ensure all team members are contributing, if not interrupt and
    gently ask them to do so
    + Suggest a better seating arrangement if you observe that it could be helpful
    + Collect submissions at the end and enter 0 / 1 for submitted / not submitted
- TAs assigned to attend classes in this capacity will also be responsible for helping
proctor midterm exams since they're available during class time.

### Grading:

#### Assignment grading:

- Lab grading:
    + TAs leading lab sections will also grade lab reports of their students.
    + Labs are completed in teams.
    + Lab grading is due one week from the due date, at the beginning of the
    following lab session.
    + Only students who were present in the lab session are listed as 
    author / discussant and receive points for the labs.
- Problem set (PS) grading:
    + All TAs will split problem set grading, divided amongst them based on
    hours they have available.
    + PSs are completed individually.
    + PS grading is due 9am on the Friday following the due date of the PS,
    no exceptions.
- If you anticipate not being able to complete the grading by the deadline, 
you must let the professor know ahead of time so that arrangements can be made.
- Stick closely to the answer key. If you catch an error on the key, or if 
something is not clear, email the professor and all TAs immediately to resolve 
the issue. This will save everyone time. If the error is minor, feel free to go 
in and edit the key directly.
- Note where you take off points, and provide ample *constructive* feedback.
- Take off points for formatting issues, especially in the first couple assignments
so that expectations are communicated early on.
- **Regrades:**
    + We only consider regrade requests in the case of errors in tallying points. 
    + All regrade requests must go through the head TA -- simply direct the students 
    to the head TA. 
    + If a student emails you about a regrade, forward the email to the head TA, 
    and cc the student letting them know this is what you're doing.

#### Project grading:

- TAs are responsible for grading Project 1 (detailed rubric will be provided).
- TAs are also responsible for attending poster sessions for Project 2 (for their
lab section), and tallying evaluations from students and the professor.

#### Exam grading / proctoring:

- TAs who regularly attend class are responsible for helping proctor midterms.
- Each section will also need 2 TAs to help proctor the final exam. Assignments
for these will be done based on availability towards the end of the semester.
- Exams must be graded promptly after class on the day of the exam. All TAs assigned
to a class are responsible for attending the grading session. Grading session time
will be determined after Week 2 of classes after everyone's schedules have solidified.
- There will be pizza at the grading session!

### Office hours:

- All TAs are expected to hold office 2 hours of office hours / week.
- Students from either of the Sta 101 sections might attend the office hours.
- Determining the exam time of your office hours will be a mix of your preference
and coverage to make sure at least one Sta 101 TA is available every day between
Sunday and Thursday.
- Please try to schedule your office hours in the afternoon to evening to be accessible
to as many students as possible (most students are in classes during the day).

### Piazza:

- Piazza is the online discussion forum, and can be accessed via the Sakai site.
- Periodically, and any time you don't have a student with you during office
hours, answer questions on Piazza.
- You will be assigned a TA role on Piazza, which means that your responses will 
be tagged as such.
- Adjust your settings so that you're notified when a note is posted on Piazza.
Respond to student questions periodically. Do not just give away the answers, 
instead respond in a way that enables the students to get to the right answer. 
Don't hesitate to answer a question with a question that helps the student think 
through the problem. 
- If it says "anon to students" do not use the student's name in your response, 
as it means the student wanted to keep their name anonymous to other students 
in the class.
- Always first invite the students to start the discussion / provide their thoughts 
if they haven't done so in their original question.

### Weekly meetings:

- We will hold weekly teaching staff meetings on **Fridays 10-11am**, location TBA.
- All TAs must attend these meetings. Be punctual so that we can get started
and finish on time.
- If you cannot attend a TA meeting, you must notify Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel
and/or Dr. Monod ahead of time.
- Format of meetings:
    1. Recap of the past week: TAs provide feedback on the past week: what seems to 
    be challenging for students, commonly missed questions on the assignments, 
    questions that commonly come up during office hours, team dynamics, etc.
    2. Head TAs give a report on grading tasks completed / to be completed.
    2. Faculty introduces topics to be discussed in the following week, and 
    any upcoming deadlines to watch out for.
    3. Discussion of upcoming lab:
        + Each week one TA presents the upcoming lab. This presentation should take 
        roughly 10 minutes and should be a **complete rehearsal** of how you plan on 
        presenting the lab to the students. You should also spend a few minutes to 
        discussing any potential difficulties that might arise during the lab. 
        + The presenter is be responsible for either creating or reviewing the
        key for the week's lab.
        + All TAs must also review the lab (i.e. actually do the entire lab) and 
        come to the meeting with suggestions / questions regarding how best to 
        present it in class.


## Part 2: Additional responsibilities of head TAs

- The head TAs for Fall 2015 are
    + David Clancy for Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel's section
    + Andrew Wong for Dr. Monod's section

- Ensure that grading is completed by the due date (check a couple days prior 
and send timely reminders if need be). You will report on this at the weekly
meeting.
- Ensure that answer keys are ready when an assignment is *assigned*.
    + If not, send an email to Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel.
- Prepare peer evaluations on Teammates and compile peer evaluation data 
(more on this later).
- Review exams and other course material as needed.
- Handle regrade requests on a weekly basis:
    + If there is an overarching problem, notify the professor.
    + Be strict, but fair.
    + "I wrote X but I meant Y" is not a good justification for earning
    points. Only give points where the grader clearly missed a correct 
    answer.
    + Be cognizant of potential academic dishonesty issues. Bring up to the
    professor's attention immediately if you suspect any such issue.
- Create lab assignments on Sakai for each lab and section. Instructions below:
    + Title: Lab X - [section time]
        * 8:30 - 9:45am
        * 10:05 - 11:20am

        * 1:25 - 2:40pm
        * 3:05 - 4:20pm
    + Open date: day & time of lab
    + Due date: day & time of due date (beginning of the following lab section)
    + Accept date: due date + 1 day
