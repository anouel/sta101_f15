Wanting to make an example of him, the Russian Mafia murders his family and banishes him from his life forever, leaving Luke to wander the streets of New York destitute, haunted by guilt, and tormented by the knowledge that he will always be watched, and anyone he develops a relationship with will also be killed. <br /><br /> But when he witnesses a frightened twelve-year-old Chinese girl, Mei, being pursued by the same gangsters who killed his wife, Luke impulsively jumps to action...and straight into the heart of a deadly high-stakes war. -- (C) Lionsgate","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ZXVII89UJ2O_5oxw9G7HNXR_F0M=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/31/11163138_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ZXVII89UJ2O_5oxw9G7HNXR_F0M=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/31/11163138_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ZXVII89UJ2O_5oxw9G7HNXR_F0M=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/31/11163138_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ZXVII89UJ2O_5oxw9G7HNXR_F0M=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/31/11163138_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Catherine Chan","id":"771158662","characters":["Mei"]},{"name":"Jason Statham","id":"162653720","characters":["Luke Wright"]},{"name":"Robert John Burke","id":"162681807","characters":["Captain Wolf"]},{"name":"James Hong","id":"364615162","characters":["Han Jiao"]},{"name":"Anson Mount","id":"162671170","characters":["Alex Rosen"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Boaz Yakin"}],"studio":"Lionsgate Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1656190"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1656190","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/safe_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242218/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242218/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242218/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242218.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
