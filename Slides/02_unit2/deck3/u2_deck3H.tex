\subsection{Two types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Two types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \hl{discrete probability distribution} lists all possible events and the probabilities with 
which they occur
\begin{itemize}
\item The events listed must be disjoint
\item Each probability must be between 0 and 1 
\item The probabilities must total 1
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item A \hl{continuous probability distribution} differs from a discrete probability distribution in 
several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability that a continuous random variable will equal to any specific value is zero.
\item As such, they cannot be expressed in tabular form.
\item Instead, we use an equation or a formula to describe its distribution via a probability density 
function (pdf).
\item We can calculate the probability for ranges of values the random variable takes (area under 
the curve).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\[ \mathhl{N(\mu,\sigma)} \]

\begin{itemize}

\item Unimodal and symmetric (bell shaped) that follows very strict guidelines about how variably 
the data are distributed around the mean \\

\pause

\item \hl{68-95-99.7 Rule:}
\begin{itemize}
\item about 68\% of the distribution falls within 1 SD of the mean
\item about 95\% falls within 2 SD of the mean
\item about 99.7\% falls within 3 SD of the mean
\item it is possible for observations to fall 4, 5, or more standard deviations away from the mean, 
but this is very rare if the data are nearly normal
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Lots of variables are nearly normal, but few are actually normal.

\subsection{Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}

A Z score creates a common scale so you can assess data without worrying about the specific 
units in which it was measured.

\disc{How can we determine if it would be unusual for an adult woman in North Carolina to be 
96'' (8 ft) tall?}

\pause

\disc{How can we determine if it would be unusual for an adult alien woman(?) to be 103 
metreloots tall, assuming the distribution of heights of adult alien women is approximately normal?}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Z scores serve as a ruler for any distribution}

\[ Z = \frac{obs - mean}{SD} \]

\begin{itemize}

\item Z score: number of standard deviations the observation falls above or below the mean

\pause

\item Defined for distributions of any shape, but only when the distribution is normal can we use 
Z scores to calculate percentiles

\pause

\item Observations with $|Z| > 2$ are usually considered \hl{unusual}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}
\label{mi4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{4. Z distribution is normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$}

\begin{itemize}

\item Linear transformations of a normally distributed random variable will also be normally 
distributed.

\pause

\item Hence, if

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}, \text{ where } X \sim N(\mu, \sigma), \]

then

\[ Z \sim N(0,1) \]

\pause

\item Z distribution is a special case of the normal distribution where $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ 
(unit normal distribution).

\pause

\item The Z distribution is also called the ``standard normal'' distribution.

\end{itemize}

standard deviation of 20. If these scores are converted to standard normal Z scores, which of 
the following statements will be correct?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The mean will equal 0, but the median cannot be determined.
\item The mean of the standardized Z-scores will equal 100.
\item The mean of the standardized Z-scores will equal 5.
\item \solnMult{Both the mean and median score will equal 0.}
\item A score of 70 is considered unusually low on this test.

\item \solnMult{In a normal distribution, Q1 and Q3 are more than one SD away from the mean.}
