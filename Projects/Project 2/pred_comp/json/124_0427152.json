Tim's fiancee, Julie, finds it distasteful and Tim agrees to skip the dinner, until he bumps into Barry - an IRS employee who devotes his spare time to building elaborate taxidermy mouse dioramas - and quickly realizes he's struck idiot gold. Tim can't resist, and invites Barry, whose blundering good intentions soon sends Tim's life into a frenzied downward spiral and a series of comic misadventures, threatening a major business deal, bringing crazy stalker ex-girlfriend, Darla, back into Tim's life and driving Julie (or so Tim thinks) into the arms of another man.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/gkV3cnLuLevSCME5XvV-jX38LR0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955547_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/gkV3cnLuLevSCME5XvV-jX38LR0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955547_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/gkV3cnLuLevSCME5XvV-jX38LR0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955547_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/gkV3cnLuLevSCME5XvV-jX38LR0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955547_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Steve Carell","id":"162652665","characters":["Barry Speck"]},{"name":"Paul Rudd","id":"162653309","characters":["Tim Conrad"]},{"name":"Zach Galifianakis","id":"162655230","characters":["Therman"]},{"name":"Jemaine Clement","id":"528345871","characters":["Kieran Vollard"]},{"name":"Stephanie Szostak","id":"770681871","characters":["Julie"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jay Roach"}],"studio":"Paramount Studios","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0427152"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0427152","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dinner_for_schmucks/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807431/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807431/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807431/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807431.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
