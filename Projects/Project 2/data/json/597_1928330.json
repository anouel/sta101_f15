It's not until forty years later when an incident on a commuter bus (where he protects an elderly black man from a pair of skin heads) makes him a local hero where he's suddenly celebrated once again. But his good fortune suddenly turns for the worse when his best friend Klondike is murdered and the police aren't doing anything about it. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3mdxPPDV339P9UTMZBJHJ2f2iM0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164352_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3mdxPPDV339P9UTMZBJHJ2f2iM0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164352_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3mdxPPDV339P9UTMZBJHJ2f2iM0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164352_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3mdxPPDV339P9UTMZBJHJ2f2iM0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164352_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Danny Trejo","id":"358124392","characters":["Frank Vega"]},{"name":"Ron Perlman","id":"162664018","characters":["Mayor Williams"]},{"name":"Joyful Drake","id":"770697542","characters":["Amber Lamps"]},{"name":"Charles S.
