George is a blue-collar American who has a special connection to the afterlife. On the other side of the world, Marie, a French journalist, has a near-death experience that shakes her reality. And when Marcus, a London schoolboy, loses the person closest to him, he desperately needs answers. Each on a path in search of the truth, their lives will intersect, forever changed by what they believe might -- or must -- exist in the hereafter.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mILs6KbbGXX-WSXKOit9P_J2UtE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/34/11153448_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mILs6KbbGXX-WSXKOit9P_J2UtE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/34/11153448_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mILs6KbbGXX-WSXKOit9P_J2UtE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/34/11153448_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mILs6KbbGXX-WSXKOit9P_J2UtE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/34/11153448_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Matt Damon","id":"162653499","characters":["George Lonegan"]},{"name":"Bryce Dallas Howard","id":"162660901","characters":["Melanie"]},{"name":"Jay Mohr","id":"162667848","characters":["Billy"]},{"name":"Richard Kind","id":"162657445","characters":["Christos"]},{"name":"Frankie McLaren","id":"771084550","characters":["Marcus/Jason"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
