Recent MIT grad Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) should be working for a Fortune 500 company and starting his upward climb to full-fledged yuppie-hood. Instead, the directionless 23-year-old confounds family and friends by taking a part-time job behind the counter of a video store at the Sherman Oaks Galleria. But Matt's silent protest against maturity comes to a screeching halt once his unrequited high school crush, Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer), walks into the store. When she invites him to an epic, end-of-summer party, Matt thinks he finally might have a chance with the girl of his dreams. With his cynical twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris) and best friend Barry (Dan Fogler), Matt embarks on a once-in-a-lifetime evening. From stealing a car to a marriage proposal to an indescribable, no-holds-barred dance-off, these friends share experiences that will change the course of their lives on one unforgettable night in the Go-Go 80s. -- (C) Relativity","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Mxs1_Ku9gJPD6vuAs4iny0RkxKQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/47/11154725_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Mxs1_Ku9gJPD6vuAs4iny0RkxKQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/47/11154725_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Mxs1_Ku9gJPD6vuAs4iny0RkxKQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/47/11154725_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Mxs1_Ku9gJPD6vuAs4iny0RkxKQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/47/11154725_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Topher Grace","id":"162664716","characters":["Matt Franklin"]},{"name":"Anna Faris","id":"162654477","characters":["Wendy Franklin"]},{"name":"Dan Fogler","id":"326396240","characters":["Barry Nathan"]},{"name":"Teresa Palmer","id":"347990464","characters":["Tori Frederking"]},{"name":"Chris Pratt","id":"770692298","characters":["Kyle Masterson"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Michael Dowse"}],"studio":"Relativity Media","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0810922"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0810922","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/young-americans/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682020/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682020/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682020/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682020.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
