A Fox Searchlight Pictures release by visionary director Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER), BLACK SWAN takes a thrilling and at times terrifying journey through the psyche of a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly perfect. BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her retired ballerina mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who zealously supports her daughter,s professional ambition. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/SU4rMy0gQAO1fnS_WunXKncSf6g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189196_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/SU4rMy0gQAO1fnS_WunXKncSf6g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189196_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/SU4rMy0gQAO1fnS_WunXKncSf6g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189196_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/SU4rMy0gQAO1fnS_WunXKncSf6g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189196_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Natalie Portman","id":"162652154","characters":["Nina Sayers/The Swan Queen"]},{"name":"Mila Kunis","id":"364629418","characters":["Lily/The Black Swan"]},{"name":"Vincent Cassel","id":"162655150","characters":["Thomas Leroy/The Gentleman"]},{"name":"Barbara Hershey","id":"162661060","characters":["Erica Sayers/The Queen"]},{"name":"Winona Ryder","id":"162659115","characters":["Beth MacIntyre/The Dying Swan"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Darren Aronofsky"}],"studio":"Fox Searchlight","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0947798"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0947798","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_swan_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
