Featuring the timeless charm, wit and whimsy of the original featurettes, this all-new movie reunites audiences with the philosophical \"bear of very little brain\" and friends Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Roo-and last, but certainly not least, Eeyore, who has lost his tail. \"Ever have one of those days where you just can't win, Eeyore?\" asks Pooh. Owl sends the whole gang on a wild quest to save Christopher Robin from an imaginary culprit. It turns out to be a very busy day for a bear who simply set out to find some honey. Inspired by three stories from A.A. Milne's books in Disney's classic, hand-drawn art style. -- (C) Walt Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O5LAOUqy0fWAhtMtBHDdhkVEIJw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155908_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O5LAOUqy0fWAhtMtBHDdhkVEIJw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155908_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O5LAOUqy0fWAhtMtBHDdhkVEIJw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155908_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O5LAOUqy0fWAhtMtBHDdhkVEIJw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155908_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jim Cummings","id":"162655841","characters":["Winnie the Pooh/Tigger"]},{"name":"Craig Ferguson","id":"162676771","characters":["Owl"]},{"name":"Jack Boulter","id":"771104993","characters":["Christopher Robin"]},{"name":"Tom Kenny","id":"162663804","characters":["Rabbit"]},{"name":"Travis Oates","id":"770805892","characters":["Piglet"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Don Hall"},{"name":"Stephen J.
