With the Fourth of July fast approaching, Kevin Carson (Bow Wow) purchases a pair of lottery tickets and settles down in front of the television to catch the winning numbers. When Kevin realizes he's just won 370 million dollars, he knows his neighbors will all come knocking the moment word of his massive windfall gets out. And he's right, too; before long, the local thugs are looking to take the ticket by force, and the sexiest girls in the neighborhood are begging to bear his children. Unfortunately for Kevin and his grandma, the lottery-claims office doesn't open until Monday, and over the next 72 hours there are more than a million ways the winning ticket could fall into the wrong hands.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Hkmwk8sILkFL0AlqSn2wK778qBY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955537_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Hkmwk8sILkFL0AlqSn2wK778qBY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955537_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Hkmwk8sILkFL0AlqSn2wK778qBY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955537_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Hkmwk8sILkFL0AlqSn2wK778qBY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/55/10955537_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bow Wow","id":"162654097","characters":["Kevin Carson"]},{"name":"Brandon T.
