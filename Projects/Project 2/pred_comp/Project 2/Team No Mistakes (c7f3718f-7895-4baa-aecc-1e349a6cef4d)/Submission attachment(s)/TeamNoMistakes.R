aa <- subset(movies, genre=="Action & Adventure")
cor(aa$audience_score, aa$year)
cor(aa$audience_score, aa$imdb_num_votes)
cor(aa$audience_score, aa$critics_score)
drama <- subset(movies, genre=="Drama")
cor(drama$audience_score, drama$runtime)
ratedr <- subset(movies, mpaa_rating == "R")
cor(ratedr$audience_score, ratedr$runtime)

cor(ratedr$audience_score, ratedr$critics_score)
bestactor<-subset(movies, best_actor_win=="yes")
cor(bestactor$audience_score, bestactor$runtime)

#### Inference:
#Is there a difference in mean audience scores between PG movies and R movies? 

#Ho(null hypothesis): There is no difference between the mean audience scores of PG movies and R movies. 

#Ha(alternative hypothesis): There is a difference between the mean audience scores of PG movies and R movies. 

#Conditions:
#1. independence: within groups, sampled obs. Must be independent (random sample/assignment, if sampling w/o replacement, n<10% of pop)
#between groups: two pops must be ind. Of each other (non-paired) This is satisfied as 64<10% of all PG-rated movies and 221<10% of all R-rated movies. Also, this data set was sampled randomly.
#2. sample size/skew: each sample size must be at least 30. This is satisfied. N > 30 for both PG-rated movies (64) and R-rated movies (221).

#### Modeling:

#We are using the backwards selection model, using p-values as our selecting criteria. We will begin with a full model. 
#We are using the backwards selection model, using p-values as our selecting criteria. We will begin with a full model. 
#Conditions for multiple linear regression:
#1. linear relationship between the explanatory variable and the response - checked using scatterplots of MLR residuals vs. each numerical explanatory variable
#2. nearly normal residuals with mean 0 - checked using a histogram of residuals
#3. constant variability of residuals - checked using residuals plots vs. predicted y (fitted residuals plot)
#4. independence of residuals and observations
#code for checking conditions is underneath this backwards p-value test

#### Prediction:

#We chose to predict information about 50 Shades of Grey. 

shadesofgrey=data.frame(type = "Feature Film", genre = "Drama", runtime = 125, year = 2015, imdb_num_votes = 135829, critics_score = 25, top200_box="yes")
predict(mlr , shadesofgrey , interval = "prediction")

#According to our model, 50 Shades of Grey, an R rated movie, is predicted to have have an audience movie score of 57.5506. The 95% prediction interval is (31.73924, 83.36196), meaning that the margin of error is 25.81136. We are 95% confident that the audience movie score of a 2015 drama feature film on the Top 200 Box Office list on BoxOfficeMojo with runtime of 125 mins and number of imdb votes = 135829 and critics score = 25 has a audience movie score between 31.73924 and 83.36196.
