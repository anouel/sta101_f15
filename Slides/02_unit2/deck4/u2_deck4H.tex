\frametitle{Considering many scenarios}

\disc{Suppose we randomly select three individuals from the US, what is the probability that exactly 1 has high-speed broadband connection at home?}

Let's call these people Anthony (A), Barry (B), Cam (C). Each one of the three
scenarios below will satisfy the condition of ``exactly 1 of them says Yes'': \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\pause
\begin{changemargin}{+1.5cm}{+0cm}
{\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Scenario 1:] $\slot{0.70}{\text{(A) \red{yes}}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(B) no}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(C) no}} \approx 0.063$
\pause
\item[Scenario 2:]  $\slot{0.30}{\text{(A) no}} \times \slot{0.70}{\text{(B) \red{yes}}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(C) no}} \approx 0.063$
\pause
\item[Scenario 3:]  $\slot{0.30}{\text{(A) no}} \times \slot{0.30}{\text{(B) no}} \times \slot{0.70}{\text{(C) \red{yes}}} \approx 0.063$
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{changemargin}
\pause
The probability of exactly one 1 of 3 people saying Yes is the sum of all of these probabilities.
\[ 0.063 + 0.063 + 0.063 = 3 \times 0.063 = 0.189 \]

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Binomial distribution}

The question from the prior slide asked for the probability of given number of successes, \mathhl{k}, in a given number of trials, \mathhl{n}, ($k = 1$ success in $n = 3$ trials), and we calculated this probability as
\[ \#~of~scenarios \times P(single~scenario) \]

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item $P(single~scenario) = p^k~(1-p)^{(n-k)}$ \\
{\tiny probability of success to the power of number of successes, probability of failure to the power of number of failures}

\pause

\item number of scenarios: ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!}$

\end{itemize}

\pause
$\:$ \\

The \hl{Binomial distribution} describes the probability of having exactly $k$
successes in $n$ independent trials with probability of success $p$.

\disc{According to the results of the Pew poll suggestion that 70\% of Americans have high-speed broadband connection at home, among a random sample of 100 Americans, how many would you expect to have such connection at home?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item $100 \times 0.70 = 70$
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Or more formally, $\mu = np = 100 \times 0.7 = 7$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item But this doesn't mean in every random sample of 100 Americans exactly 70 will have high-speed broadband connection at home. In some samples there will be fewer of those, and in others more. How much would we expect this value to vary?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{100 \times 0.70 \times 0.30} \approx  4.58$

You can use the normal distribution to approximate binomial probabilities when
the sample size is large enough.

\hfill \\

\pause

\hl{S-F rule:} 
The sample size is considered large enough if the expected number of successes and failures are both at least 10
\[ np \ge 10 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad n(1-p) \ge 10 \]

\item Using the normal approximation to the binomial: Since we have at least expected successes
$(1000 \times 0.7 = 700)$ and 10 expected failures $(1000 \times 0.3 = 300)$,

\begin{align*}
Binom&(n = 1000, p = 0.7) \sim \\
&N(\mu = 1000 \times 0.7, \sigma = \sqrt{1000 \times 0.7 \times 0.3})
