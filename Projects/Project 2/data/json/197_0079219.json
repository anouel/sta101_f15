They live off social security checks and spend their days sitting on a park bench, reading newspapers, feeding pigeons, and fending off obnoxious children. It's a dull life, and finally Joe is driven to suggest something radical to break the monotony; why not go on a stick up? None of them have a criminal history (though Joe claims he \"did some stealing during the war\"), but just planning the bank robbery puts a new spring in their step. Al surreptitiously borrows some pistols from the collection of his nephew, Pete (Charles Hallahan), and the trio, disguised with novelty Groucho Marx-style glasses, pulls off their heist to the tune of 35,000 dollars. Unfortunately, the excitement is too much for Willie, who suffers a fatal heart attack the same day. At his funeral, Joe and Al decide to give the bulk of the dough to Pete and his family, and attempt to blow the rest of it on a whirlwind excursion to Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the eccentric robbery has become a colorful news story for the media and the police are closing in on the amateur criminals. ~ Fred Beldin, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KqBTEuBBfbVSJRTCnKC4o9V9HJw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/63/11166385_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KqBTEuBBfbVSJRTCnKC4o9V9HJw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/63/11166385_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KqBTEuBBfbVSJRTCnKC4o9V9HJw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/63/11166385_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KqBTEuBBfbVSJRTCnKC4o9V9HJw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/63/11166385_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"George Burns","id":"162670142","characters":["Joe"]},{"name":"Art Carney","id":"162669887","characters":["Al"]},{"name":"Lee Strasberg","id":"162679725","characters":["Willie"]},{"name":"Charles Hallahan","id":"439091428","characters":["Pete"]},{"name":"Pamela Payton-Wright","id":"770729525","characters":["Kathy"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Zach Braff"},{"name":"Theodore Melfi"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
