Nearly 65, he remains the living embodiment of the rock and roll lifestyle, and this feature-length documentary tells his story, one of a hard-living rock icon who continues to enjoy the life of a man half his age. Shot on a combination of High Definition and Super 16mm film, \"Lemmy\" includes interviews with friends, family, bandmates past and present and such admirers/peers as Metallica, Slash, Dave Grohl (Nirvana/Foo Fighters), Ozzy Osbourne, Peter Hook (Joy Division/New Order), actor Billy Bob Thornton, wrestling superstar Triple H, Alice Cooper, Mick Jones of The Clash, and many more. Called \"pure gold\" by WIRED, \"Lemmy\" made its world premiere in March 2010 at the South by Southwest Film and Music Festival, and has since collected rave reviews at film festivals around the globe. Variety remarked \"'Lemmy' rocks,\" and The Hollywood Reporter noted, \"You don't have to be a metalhead to love 'Lemmy.'\" -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/p8TLAR8A7QjMq18HWtXo990O8mw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155163_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/p8TLAR8A7QjMq18HWtXo990O8mw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155163_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/p8TLAR8A7QjMq18HWtXo990O8mw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155163_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/p8TLAR8A7QjMq18HWtXo990O8mw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155163_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Dave Brock","id":"770906019"},{"name":"Phil Campbell","id":"770832762"},{"name":"Fast Eddie Clarke","id":"771092560"},{"name":"Jarvis Cocker","id":"208135193"},{"name":"Alice Cooper","id":"364625202"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Greg Olliver"},{"name":"Wes Orshoski"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1236472"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1236472","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lemmy_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221724/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221724/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221724/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221724.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
