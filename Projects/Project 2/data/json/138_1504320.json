With his country on the brink of war and in desperate need of a leader, his wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), the future Queen Mother, arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). After a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment and eventually form an unbreakable bond. With the support of Logue, his family, his government and Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall), the King will overcome his stammer and deliver a radio-address that inspires his people and unites them in battle. Based on the true story of King George VI, THE KING'S SPEECH follows the Royal Monarch's quest to find his voice. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PdEtSNYeKQUkR5MhaKrsb7QOWXo=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154473_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PdEtSNYeKQUkR5MhaKrsb7QOWXo=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154473_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PdEtSNYeKQUkR5MhaKrsb7QOWXo=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154473_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PdEtSNYeKQUkR5MhaKrsb7QOWXo=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154473_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Colin Firth","id":"162654659","characters":["King George 'Bertie' VI"]},{"name":"Geoffrey Rush","id":"162659119","characters":["Lionel Logue"]},{"name":"Derek Jacobi","id":"162656362","characters":["Archbishop Cosmo Lang"]},{"name":"Guy Pearce","id":"162660324","characters":["King Edward VIII"]},{"name":"Timothy Spall","id":"162698684","characters":["Winston Churchill"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tom Hooper"}],"studio":"The Weinstein Company","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1504320"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1504320","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_kings_speech/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816664/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816664/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816664/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816664.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
