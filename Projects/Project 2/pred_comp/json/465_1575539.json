Elena (Necar Zadegan) is the wife of Barry (Gary Weeks) and the mother of a teenage son, Nash (Connor Kramme). Barry is a pastor who has been active in a local campaign to prevent the legalization of same-sex marriage; while Barry speaks with vigor against gays, he's prompted more by the whims of well-to-do members of the congregation than his own feelings, and Elena is quietly appalled by his actions. Barry is also eager to have another child while Elena is not, adding to the emotional gulf between them. While seeing a relationship therapist, Elena meets Peyton (Traci Dinwiddie), a successful writer whose work deals with her struggle to overcome agoraphobia. Elena is an accomplished photographer, and when Peyton asks if she'd like to contribute pictures to an upcoming project, she immediately agrees. As Elena spends more time with Peyton, she becomes aware that her new friend is a lesbian, and their mutual admiration gives way to deeper feelings. Elena realizes she's fallen in love with Peyton, and must decide if she should end her loveless marriage to pursue a relationship that is entirely new to her; Peyton, meanwhile, has fallen for Elena, but has just gotten out of a failing relationship and isn't sure she can start a new romance so soon. Elena Undone was an official selection at the 2010 San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/L2PjF67OIzS_CwLDabEZheet3h0=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157345_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/L2PjF67OIzS_CwLDabEZheet3h0=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157345_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/L2PjF67OIzS_CwLDabEZheet3h0=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157345_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/L2PjF67OIzS_CwLDabEZheet3h0=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157345_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Necar Zadegan","id":"771066949"},{"name":"Gary Weeks (II)","id":"770674426"},{"name":"Connor Kramme","id":"771072815"},{"name":"Traci Dinwiddie","id":"770674342"},{"name":"Sam Harris","id":"770675661"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Nicole Conn"}],"studio":"Wolfe Video","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1575539"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1575539","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elena_undone/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202370/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202370/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202370/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202370.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
