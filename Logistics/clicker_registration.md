# Instructions for in class clicker registration

- Go to Sakai -> Gradebook 
- Click on the All grades tab, and then Export as CSV
- Place the exported file in the i>clicker class folder,
and rename it as sakaigradebook.csv
    - To locate this folder browse to i>clicker in your
    applications, then Classes, and then the folder
    for this semester's class
- Open the sakaigradebook.csv, remove all columns other
than
    - Student ID
    - Student Name
and re-save
- Open i>clicker (but don't start session)
- Go to Edit -> My Settings and click on the LMS / Reg tab
- Make sure under Learning Management System (LMS) Sakai
is selected
- Under In-class (roll call) registration check all (last
name, first name, student ID), and click Save for course
- Close out of i>clicker
- Open i>grader and click Sync (must be online to do this)
    - you may need to hit Accept or Ignore a few times to 
    match students to their registrations in the pop-up window
        - if the Net ID matches hit Accept
        - if not, hit Ignore
        - some students might have used another ID (like
        their Duke ID instead of Net ID, if name matches
        then hit Accept)
    - this step will take care of students who were able to
    register their clickers online
- Close out of i>grader and open i>clicker
- Start session
