Media spin, PR scare tactics, dirty tricks, lawsuits, and corporate bullying come into play, but it is the people who ultimately prevail, thus creating a cautionary tale and a real life lesson learning experience. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dGNOoX-zQytcwAZ74BQ0PeOEsoI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166038_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dGNOoX-zQytcwAZ74BQ0PeOEsoI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166038_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dGNOoX-zQytcwAZ74BQ0PeOEsoI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166038_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dGNOoX-zQytcwAZ74BQ0PeOEsoI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166038_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Arvid Jurjaks","id":"771394536"},{"name":"Bart Simpson","id":"335716553"},{"name":"Bernt Hermele","id":"771394537"},{"name":"Charlotte Lundgren","id":"771415355"},{"name":"Dan Koeppel","id":"771144160"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Fredrik Gertten"}],"studio":"WG Film","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2090463"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2090463","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_boys_gone_bananas_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267234/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267234/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267234/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267234.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
