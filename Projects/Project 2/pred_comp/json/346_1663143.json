Before that can happen, Wren's mother, Joy, insists that she watch her little brother Albert on Halloween night, so Joy can go to a rager with her much younger boyfriend. When Wren gets distracted by an invitation to the party of the year, Albert disappears into a sea of trick-or-treaters. Frantic to locate him before their mother discovers he's missing, Wren enlists the help of her sassy best friend April, as well as Peng, an aspiring ladies man and co-captain of the debate team, and Peng's best friend, Roosevelt, a sweet nerd whose crush on Wren clouds his better judgment. This unlikely foursome embarks on a high-stakes, all-night adventure to find Albert, crossing paths with outrageous characters every step of the way. -- (C) Paramount","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_j3KSUD7k7GbLA-YMu3GLYfIvs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/92/11169205_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_j3KSUD7k7GbLA-YMu3GLYfIvs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/92/11169205_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_j3KSUD7k7GbLA-YMu3GLYfIvs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/92/11169205_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_j3KSUD7k7GbLA-YMu3GLYfIvs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/92/11169205_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Victoria Justice","id":"491864285","characters":["Wren"]},{"name":"Thomas Mann","id":"770806969","characters":["Roosevelt"]},{"name":"Jane Levy","id":"771394557","characters":["April"]},{"name":"Thomas McDonell","id":"771078587","characters":["Aaron Riley"]},{"name":"Jackson Nicoll","id":"771091208","characters":["Albert"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Josh Schwartz"}],"studio":"Paramount Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1663143"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1663143","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fun_size/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249550/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249550/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249550/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249550.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
