# send out ~week before beginning of classes

Welcome to Sta 101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference!

Hi class,

The course website is at bit.ly/sta101_f15, and is still under construction so anticipate further updates between now and the beginning of the semester. All relevant course material will be posted here.

This email contains information on required materials for this course as well as links to resources for getting ready for the course.

Required materials:
1. Textbook: OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition (ISBN: 978-1943450039):
    - The textbook is freely available online at http://www.openintro.org/os. You're welcomed to read on screen or print it out.
    - If you prefer a paperback version you can buy it at the cost of printing (under $10.14) [on Amazon](www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=amazon_os3&referrer=/stat/textbook.php).
    - The textbook store will not carry copies of this text.

2. Clicker: i>clicker2 (ISBN: 978-1429280471):
    - If you would like to purchase a used clicker from a former student, see the list of students selling their clickers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkY2lFgS9uiDdE1fMkZUZnp6alJDSG9tYlIwTFJWdnc#gid=0). You can contact them directly, or leave your name on the list under "Wants to buy clicker".
    - The clickers will also be available at the Duke textbook store.
    - Or you can get them for slightly cheaper [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/I-Clicker-2-I-Clicker/dp/1429280476).
    - Note that this is i>clicker2, and not i>clicker or i>clicker+.

* Optional: You will be allowed to use a calculator in this class. There is no restrictions on the type of calculator. A simple calculator that can take square roots should be sufficient.

If you are planning on ordering your materials online I recommend that you do so right away so that they arrive by the time classes begin. Note that Amazon offers free 2-day Prime shipping to students: http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info.

Resources for Unit 1:
I recommend that you start reviewing the resources for Unit 1 (linked at bit.ly/sta101_f15#unit1): watch the videos and use the learning objectives as a checklist. This material is also covered in Chapter 1 of the textbook. We will have a readiness assessment on Wednesday, Aug 26 on this material. This readiness assessment is not graded (for practice only), but I recommend preparing for it as it is graded, so that you can get a better sense of the difficulty level of these assessments.


Enjoy the last few days of the summer break.

Looking forward to meeting all of you soon.

Best,
Dr. Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel
