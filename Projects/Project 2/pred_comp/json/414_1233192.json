When a young and very innocent waitress, Rose, stumbles on evidence linking him to a revenge killing, he sets out to seduce her to secure her silence. The film stars up-and-coming British actors Sam Riley and Andrea Riseborough as the young couple. Veterans Helen Mirren and John Hurt co-star as two friends who set out to save Rose from Pinkie's deviant designs. Brighton Rock is based on the iconic 1939 Graham Greene novel of innocence and evil but the action has been updated to 1964 Britain, the year the Mods and the Rockers were rioting across the South Coast. The 60s were also the era of the great British gangster, the kind of working class hero, the frightened and ambitious Pinkie longs to be. -- (C) Offical Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/VXLpj3dNqoNvS5obK5l9aqYzlXM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/91/11159124_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/VXLpj3dNqoNvS5obK5l9aqYzlXM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/91/11159124_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/VXLpj3dNqoNvS5obK5l9aqYzlXM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/91/11159124_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/VXLpj3dNqoNvS5obK5l9aqYzlXM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/91/11159124_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sam Riley","id":"770673828","characters":["Pinkie Brown"]},{"name":"Andrea Riseborough","id":"770704179","characters":["Rose Brown"]},{"name":"Helen Mirren","id":"162662871","characters":["Ida"]},{"name":"John Hurt","id":"162653221","characters":["Phil Corkery"]},{"name":"Andy Serkis","id":"269710329","characters":["Colleoni"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Rowan Joffe"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1233192"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1233192","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brighton_rock-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872016/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872016/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872016/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872016.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
