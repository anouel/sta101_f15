With our country's entire counter-terrorism force rushing to action, the culprit is soon apprehended, but the whereabouts of his bombs remain unknown. Heading up the investigation-or so she thinks-is FBI agent Helen Brody, an expert in her field, who has only two days to find the bombs but who, unfortunately, is not making much progress. Then, Brody is forced to work alongside a freelance interrogator, known only as \"H\" (Jackson), whose brutal methods are diametrically opposed to hers. \"H\" crosses lines that no one else will, but since he gets results, he has the full support of the government. With the clock ticking, and the moral compass constantly shifting, Brody-and the audience-must question their most basic assumptions about fear and paranoia, about strength and cruelty, and about right and wrong. Under the expert guidance of director Gregor Jordan, \"Unthinkable,\" stands.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yEf4Oj0KjZAZUvU_I9aJ6z_meqY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151736_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yEf4Oj0KjZAZUvU_I9aJ6z_meqY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151736_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yEf4Oj0KjZAZUvU_I9aJ6z_meqY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151736_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yEf4Oj0KjZAZUvU_I9aJ6z_meqY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/17/11151736_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Samuel L.
