Enoch Brae (Henry Hopper) is a young man who has dropped out of the business of living, after an accident claimed the life of his parents. When these two outsiders chance to meet at a funeral, they find an unexpected common ground in their unique experiences of the world. For Enoch, it includes his best friend Hiroshi (Ryo Kase) who happens to be the ghost of a Kamikaze fighter pilot. For Annabel, it involves an admiration of Charles Darwin and an interest in how other creatures live. Upon learning of Annabel's imminent early passing, Enoch offers to help her face her last days with an irreverent abandon, tempting fate, tradition and even death itself. As their unique love for each other grows, so do the realities of the world that they have felt closing in on them. Daring, childlike, and distinctly rare - these two bravely face what life has in store for them. Fighting pain, anger and loss with youth, playfulness and originality, these two misfits turn the tables on life and play by their own rules. Their journey begins to collide with the unstoppable march of time, as the natural cycle of life comes to claim Annabel. -- (C) Sony Classics","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/kcUaGxklEZ41KLi40PZEUvqI5wU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/85/11158577_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/kcUaGxklEZ41KLi40PZEUvqI5wU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/85/11158577_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/kcUaGxklEZ41KLi40PZEUvqI5wU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/85/11158577_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/kcUaGxklEZ41KLi40PZEUvqI5wU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/85/11158577_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Henry Hopper","id":"771084963","characters":["Enoch"]},{"name":"Mia Wasikowska","id":"770688391","characters":["Annabel"]},{"name":"Ryo Kase","id":"411002220","characters":["Hiroshi"]},{"name":"Schuyler Fisk","id":"162672658","characters":["Elizabeth"]},{"name":"Jane Adams (II)","id":"364658905","characters":["Mabel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Gus Van Sant"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1498569"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1498569","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/restless_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202904/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202904/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202904/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202904.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
