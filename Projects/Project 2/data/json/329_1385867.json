From a script by Robb and Mark Cullen, the story centers around police detectives Jimmy (Willis), a no-B.S. divorced dad, and Paul (Morgan), a crazy-talking loose cannon. Despite nine years as partners, the two lawmen can still sometimes seem like polar opposites -- especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash and trying to pay for his daughter's wedding, Jimmy decides to sell a rare baseball card that's worth tens of thousands. Unfortunately, when the collector's shop is robbed and the card vanishes with the crook, Paul and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring behind its theft, all on their own time, and without any backup -- except for each other. ~ Cammila Collar, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jv3X1xq5-KGldM80I3HgJEILlH8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/99/11169914_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jv3X1xq5-KGldM80I3HgJEILlH8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/99/11169914_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jv3X1xq5-KGldM80I3HgJEILlH8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/99/11169914_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jv3X1xq5-KGldM80I3HgJEILlH8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/99/11169914_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bruce Willis","id":"162652509","characters":["Jimmy"]},{"name":"Tracy Morgan","id":"326393834","characters":["Paul"]},{"name":"Adam Brody","id":"162652628","characters":["Barry Mangold"]},{"name":"Kevin Pollak","id":"162675617","characters":["Hunsaker"]},{"name":"Seann William Scott","id":"162652909","characters":["Dave"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Kevin Smith"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
