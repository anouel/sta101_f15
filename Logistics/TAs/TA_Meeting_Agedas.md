TO DO for Mine:
* Updates for intro_to_data lab:
  + summary() should be removed earlier as it doesn't work with group_by() later
  + `position = "fill"` is not clear, help files not sufficient, add
  further discussion in lab (or consider removing)
* Add to next lab: discussion on environments [Done in probability lab]
* Add to last lab of the semester: discussion on how to work on desktop + packages
* Review EOCEs for inconsistencies with answer key or unclear wording:
  + 1.32 - Berkeley students: target population vs. everyone
  + 1.70 - "claims" might not be clear null and alternative
* Going forward on the PS keys use the following type of wording: "1 pt for 
only stating reject/not reject, 2 pts for in context discussion of results"
