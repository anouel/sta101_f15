In Blackthorn, Cassidy (Shepard) survived, and is quietly living out his years under the name James Blackthorn in a secluded Bolivian village. Tired of his long exile from the US and hoping to see his family again before he dies, Cassidy sets out on the long journey home. But when an unexpected encounter with an ambitious young criminal (Eduardo Noriega) derails his plans, he is thrust into one last adventure, the likes of which he hasn't experienced since his glory days with the Sundance Kid. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3rmUpjZ9Y6YhiqHSyI3uhrj5ueU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160216_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3rmUpjZ9Y6YhiqHSyI3uhrj5ueU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160216_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3rmUpjZ9Y6YhiqHSyI3uhrj5ueU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160216_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3rmUpjZ9Y6YhiqHSyI3uhrj5ueU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160216_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sam Shepard","id":"162662816","characters":["James Blackthorn"]},{"name":"Eduardo Noriega","id":"162733336","characters":["Eduardo Apocada"]},{"name":"Stephen Rea","id":"162655349","characters":["Mackinley"]},{"name":"Magaly Solier","id":"601286038","characters":["Yana"]},{"name":"Nikolaj Coster-Waldau","id":"559808757","characters":["Young James"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mateo Gil"}],"studio":"Magnolia Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1629705"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1629705","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blackthorn/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234366/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234366/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234366/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234366.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
