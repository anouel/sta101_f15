His best friend Doc (Christopher Walken) is there to pick him up, and the two soon re-team with another old pal, Hirsch (Alan Arkin). Their bond is as strong as ever, and the three reflect on freedom lost and gained, loyalties ebbed and flowed, and days of glory gone by. But one of the friends is keeping a dangerous secret- he's been put in an impossible quandary by a former mob boss, and his time to find an acceptable alternative is running out. As the sun rises on the guys' legendary reunion, their position becomes more and more desperate and they finally confront their past once and for all. -- (C) Lionsgate","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_ZnMPU2fy2ZM8nHoEcLz4Zl3T8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171323_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_ZnMPU2fy2ZM8nHoEcLz4Zl3T8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171323_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_ZnMPU2fy2ZM8nHoEcLz4Zl3T8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171323_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x_ZnMPU2fy2ZM8nHoEcLz4Zl3T8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171323_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Al Pacino","id":"162654461","characters":["Val"]},{"name":"Christopher Walken","id":"162652837","characters":["Doc"]},{"name":"Alan Arkin","id":"162666144","characters":["Hirsch"]},{"name":"Julianna Margulies","id":"162663347","characters":["Nina Hirsch"]},{"name":"Addison Timlin","id":"770758596","characters":["Alex"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Fisher Stevens"}],"studio":"Lionsgate","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1389096"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1389096","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stand_up_guys/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269006/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269006/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269006/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269006.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
