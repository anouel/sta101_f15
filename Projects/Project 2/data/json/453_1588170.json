Oldboy's CHOI Min-sik plays Kyung-chul, a dangerous psychopath who kills for pleasure. The embodiment of pure evil, he has committed horrifying and senselessly cruel serial murders on defenseless victims, successfully eluding capture by the police. On a freezing, snowy night, his latest victim is the beautiful Ju-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief and pregnant fiancee of elite special agent Soo-hyun (The Good, The Bad, The Weird's LEE Byung-hyun). Obsessed with revenge, Soo-hyun decides to track down the murderer, even if doing so means becoming a monster himself. And when he finds Kyung-chul, turning him in to the authorities is the last thing on his mind. The lines between good and evil fall away in this diabolically twisted game of cat and mouse. Pushing the concept of revenge to its most extreme limits, KIM Jee-woon brilliantly transcends the police procedural and serial killer genres in surprising and thrilling new ways. -- (C) Magnet","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/V6RnJqFP9v0HyQTTU3OqiDAVd4I=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155175_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/V6RnJqFP9v0HyQTTU3OqiDAVd4I=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155175_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/V6RnJqFP9v0HyQTTU3OqiDAVd4I=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155175_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/V6RnJqFP9v0HyQTTU3OqiDAVd4I=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/51/11155175_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Byung-hun Lee","id":"285359670","characters":["Soo-hyun"]},{"name":"Min-sik Choi","id":"162695879","characters":["Kyung-chul"]},{"name":"Chun Kook-Haun","id":"771097091","characters":["Capt.
