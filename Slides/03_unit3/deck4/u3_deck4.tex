Always check these in context of the data and the research question!

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hlGr{Independence:} Sampled observations must be independent. \\
* This is difficult to verify, but is more likely if
\begin{itemize}
\item random sampling/assignment is used, and,
\item if sampling without replacement, $n$ $<$ 10\% of the population.
\end{itemize}

\item \hlGr{Sample size/skew:} Either the population distribution is normal or $n > 30$ and the population distribution is not extremely skewed (the more skewed the distribution, the higher $n$ necessary for the CLT to apply).\\
* This is also difficult to verify for the population, but we can check it using the sample data, and assume that the sample mirrors the population.

\frametitle{Common misconceptions about confidence intervals}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{gray}{The confidence level of a confidence interval is the
probability that the true population parameter is in the confidence
interval you construct for a single sample.} \\
\textit{The confidence level is equal to the proportion of random samples that result
in confidence intervals that contain the true pop.\ parameter.} \\

\pause

\item \textcolor{gray}{A narrower confidence interval is always better.}\\
\textit{This is incorrect since the width is a function of both the confidence level and 
the standard error.} \\

\pause

\item \textcolor{gray}{A wider interval means less confidence.} \\

\textit{This is incorrect since it is possible to make very precise statements with very 
little confidence.} \\

\frametitle{4. Use hypothesis tests to make decisions about population parameters}

Hypothesis testing framework:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses.

\item Check assumptions and conditions.

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value.

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis testing for a population mean}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item $H_0: \mu = null~value$
\item $H_A: \mu <$ or $>$ or $\ne null~value$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Check assumptions and conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence: random sample/assignment, 10\% condition when sampling without replacement
\item Sample size / skew: $n \ge 30$ (or larger if sample is skewed), no extreme skew
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value (draw a picture!)
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE},~where~SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

\pause

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question
\begin{itemize}
\item If p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$, data provide evidence for $H_A$
\item If p-value $> \alpha$, do not reject $H_0$, data do not provide evidence for $H_A$
