Told through the explorer s poignant and evocative letters to his wife, Ruth, previously unseen photos and film archive from 1924 (restored from the original nitrate especially for the film), dramatization and a modern-day expedition retracing the original route taken in 1924, Mallory s incredible adventure lives again. The expedition was led by renowned mountaineer Conrad Anker, whose life became inextricably linked with Mallory s after he found Mallory s body on Everest in 1999. Using replica 1920s-era clothing and equipment, Anker sets out to solve the great mystery of whether Mallory succeeded in summiting Everest before he died he was last seen just 800 feet from the summit before the clouds closed in and he disappeared into legend. The most heartbreaking clue: All of Mallory s belongings were found intact on his body, except the photograph of his beloved Ruth, which he promised to leave at the top of the world if he succeeded. -- (C) National Geographic","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sGbCmVAVprgtOj_9pasdozuvAe4=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168666_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sGbCmVAVprgtOj_9pasdozuvAe4=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168666_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sGbCmVAVprgtOj_9pasdozuvAe4=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168666_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sGbCmVAVprgtOj_9pasdozuvAe4=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168666_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Liam Neeson","id":"162652242","characters":["Narrator"]},{"name":"Natasha Richardson","id":"162653239","characters":["Voice of Ruth Mallory"]},{"name":"Ralph Fiennes","id":"162653681","characters":["George Mallory"]},{"name":"Ruth Mallory","id":"771553027","characters":["Natasha Richardson"]},{"name":"Alan Rickman","id":"162666132","characters":["Noel Odell"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Anthony Geffen"}],"studio":"National Geographic Cinema Ventures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1509276"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1509276","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wildest_dream_conquest_of_everest/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872129/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872129/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872129/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770872129.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
